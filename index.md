# Introduction

This lab is all about testing the strengths and weaknesses of a firewall. It will look at the inbound and outbound rules of a firewall for a wireless network and show how Nessus can be used to detect the early signs of a potential cyber-attack. The firewall will then be modified to counteract this threat and prevent others from occurring.

# Hands-On Demonstration

## Examine a pfSense Server Firewall Configuration

The only thing of note here is that my server's firewall configuration contains a WAN rule that exposes the server to the entire public network. This will be relevant throughout the lab.

## Social Engineering / Reverse Social Engineering Attack

### Run a basic network scan

In this step, I use Nessus to run a basic network scan of the TargetWindows01 computer. The results can be seen in the screenshot below. According to the graphs, there are a total of twelve low-to-medium vulnerabilities.
